# Evolution-Simulation
This project was completed as part of the Object Oriented Programming course at AGH UST 2021/2022 

## Description
This project aims to simulate life, death and evolution of animals on a rectangle map given a set of rules to follow. 
Each animal has energy that is spent each cycle on movement or reproduction. The direction is determined by genome of a specimen that is passed on to its descendants. 
Energy is replenished by finding and eating plants.

## Features 
- Ability to control starting paramethers 

- Creation of jungle area with better spawn rates of plants

- Simultaneous simulation of two types of worlds - with walls and without

- Graphs for number of animals, avarege energy, number of plants, average lifespan, average number of children

- Dynamic display of dominant genome

- Ability to follow one animal, number of its children and descendants

- Data export to CSV

## Tech Stack
- Java 16
- Gradle
- JavaFX
